# Codes for fish data

To run this code, you need to install basic numpy, matplotlib, and pickle packages.

Download data from xxx, and relase them at a folder named "Data"

To get the bifurcation, run [ReadTwoFishStimliEqualDis_Bifurcation_Vivek.ipynb](ReadTwoFishStimliEqualDis_Bifurcation_Vivek.ipynb).

To get the trification, run [ReadThreeFishStimliEqualDis_Trifurcation_Vivek.ipynb](ReadThreeFishStimliEqualDis_Trifurcation_Vivek.ipynb)

To get the density plot of one real fish following two virtual fish, run [DensityPlotsRaw.ipynb](DensityPlotsRaw.ipynb)

To get the decision of the following behaviour with 3 virtual fish in asymmetrical formation, run [3VF_Backforth_Asymmetrical.ipynb](3VF_Backforth_Asymmetrical.ipynb)

To compare the speed control of the focual fish reacting to real and virtual fish, run [SpeedVSposition.ipynb](SpeedVSposition.ipynb)

To comapre the z-difference between real and virtual fish, run [xyz_spatial_distribution.ipynb](xyz_spatial_distribution.ipynb)
