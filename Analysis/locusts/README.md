Like the flyVR experiments, automating the locustVR experiments was also done using [SQLite databases](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html). Once again, the "project databases" contain different randomisations which could be used to run the experiment and the "experiment databases" contain randomisations for which experiments were conducted. However, unlike the flyVR experiments, the locustVR experiments have four project databases and four experiment databases. [locustProjects_19_11_28.db](locustProjects_19_11_28.db), [locustProjects_20_01_07.db](locustProjects_20_01_07.db), [locustExperiments_19_11_28.db](locustExperiments_19_11_28.db) and [locustExperiments_20_01_07.db](locustExperiments_20_01_07.db) correspond to the two-choice decision-making scenario while [locustProjects_2_3post.db](locustProjects_2_3post.db), [locustProjects_2_3post-june.db](locustProjects_2_3post-june.db), [locustExperiments_2_3post.db](locustExperiments_2_3post.db) and [locustExperiments_2_3post-june.db](locustExperiments_2_3post-june.db) correspond to the three-choice decision-making.

To reproduce the two-choice decision-making plots in the manuscript, run the [quantify_bifurcations_n2.ipynb](quantify_bifurcations_n2.ipynb). To reproduce the three-choice decision-making plots in the manuscript, run the [quantify_bifurcations_n3.ipynb](quantify_bifurcations_n3.ipynb). The required dependencies can be inferred from the first cell on this jupyter notebooks. Please ensure you have all required dependencies while running this code.
