Instructions
------------

To run this code, you need to install basic numpy, matplotlib, and pickle packages.

1.  To produce the two-choice decision-making plot, run [ReadTwoFishStimliEqualDis_Bifurcation_Vivek.ipynb](ReadTwoFishStimliEqualDis_Bifurcation_Vivek.ipynb).
2.  To produce the three-choice decision-making plot, run [ReadThreeFishStimliEqualDis_Trifurcation_Vivek.ipynb](ReadThreeFishStimliEqualDis_Trifurcation_Vivek.ipynb)
3.  To get the density plot of one real fish following two virtual fish, run [DensityPlotsRaw.ipynb](DensityPlotsRaw.ipynb)
4.  To get the decision of the following behaviour with 3 virtual fish in asymmetrical formation, run [3VF_Backforth_Asymmetrical.ipynb](3VF_Backforth_Asymmetrical.ipynb)
5.  To compare the speed control of the focual fish reacting to real and virtual fish, run [SpeedVSposition.ipynb](SpeedVSposition.ipynb)
6.  To comapre the z-difference between real and virtual fish, run [xyz_spatial_distribution.ipynb](xyz_spatial_distribution.ipynb)
